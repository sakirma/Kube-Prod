# Kube-Prod

Hello! Welcome to Kube-Prod. This project is my personal journey into learning how to set up and manage a Kubernetes cluster for a production environment. As I navigate through the complexities of Kubernetes, I'm documenting and sharing my progress, hoping to make the path easier for others on the same journey.

## Why I Started Kube-Prod

I embarked on this project with a clear goal: to understand Kubernetes from the ground up, specifically how to deploy it in a real-world, production scenario. Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications, but mastering it for production use comes with its challenges. Through Kube-Prod, I aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice, compiling the lessons learned and best practices discovered along the way.
