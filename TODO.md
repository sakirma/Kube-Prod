# TODO

- Use Dev Space instead of skaffold?
- Implement Istio ambient
  - Would be nice to save lots of resources by not deploying any istio sidecars
  - https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/ambient/getting-started/ This got deployed easily.
    Still would like to see if monitoring will work out of the box.
